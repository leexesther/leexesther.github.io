        We started Half Foods in 2015 to combat food insecurity and to address the lack of healthy, accessible foods throughout the nation. 
        While a myriad health food franchises exist within America, many tend to avoid underserved and financially disadvantaged communities, further
        exacerbating the problem. (Not to mention, they can be pretty expensive and whitewashed -- this is definitely a subtweet.) Half Foods slashes prices in half by eliminating third party grocery suppliers and saving even "imperfect", produce. 
        Our products are comparable to popular American health food brands, and we often draw inspiration from them.
        Our grocery stores are limited-stock and excess produce is always donated to local food kitchens and shelters. Visit one of 131 locations, or 
        order delivery from our website (soon to be released).
